The fundamental of this project is in the works.

All alternative perspectives are being drafted.

Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
