## There is no Such Thing as a Dumb Question... or Is There?

Most of us have heard the old saying, "There is no such thing as a dumb question," right? But if we’re being honest, not every question is equally effective. As a new coder, myself, we have to take the time to learn how to formulate smart questions after ["RTFM"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#rtfm) or ["STFW"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#rtfm) before asking for help. Eric Steven Raymond actually talks about this in his guide, "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way," and he suggests that there might be such a thing as a stupid question after all. Raymond's open source provides a guideline for newbies in the software engineering world on seeking help in a more efficient way. The idea is that while curiosity is always welcome, how you ask matters, a poorly written question can make things harder for everyone involved. So maybe it’s not about whether a question is dumb, but whether it’s asked in a competent manner.

## Some Pointers to Smart Questions:
  <br>
•	As indicated by "RTFM" or "STFW", try to research the answer before asking in a forum. 
  <br>
•	Pay attention to where and how you are posting your questions (e.g., Does the forum match the technical level of your question? Is your question easy to read? Is your question easy to reply to?)
  <br>
•	Accuracy in describing your problem and your own steps taken in attempting a solution should be a given.
  <br>
•	Size matters! Simplify code, but also be informative in your headlines and questions.
  <br>

## Example of a "Smart" Question and a "Not So Smart" Question on StackOverflow:

•	"Smart" Question: 
["How can I prevent SQL injection in PHP?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-can-i-prevent-sql-injection-in-php)
 If user input is inserted without modification into an SQL query, then the application becomes vulnerable to SQL injection, like in the following example:
[code inserted]
That's because the user can input something like value'); DROP TABLE table;--, and the query becomes:
[result inserted]
What can be done to prevent this from happening?"
•	"Not So Smart" Question (AI Generated - Not a real post!):
"HELP! I need to do a website!:
My boss said I need to make a website for the company using PHP and JavaScript. I'm completely new to this and don't know where to start. What's the fastest and easiest way to do this? Is there some code you can give me?"
<br>

## Don't be like Bart Simpson. Ask "smart" questions.

If you run into a problem, try tackling it yourself first. A lot of questions have already been answered, so take a good thorough look through any FAQs or guides you can find. Honestly, I have been surprised at how much info is already out there. If you’re still stuck after doing your homework, look for a forum or community that may match the level of your question. When you finally ask for help, make sure to explain your issue clearly, provide all the details someone would need, and present it in a way you’d appreciate if you were the subject matter expert. This helps others help you faster and saves everyone time in the long run.
