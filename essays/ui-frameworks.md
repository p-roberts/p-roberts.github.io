## What is Bootstrap 5?

First, what is Bootstrap 5? According to w3schools.com, Bootstrap is the most popular open-source front-end framework used for “developing creating responsive and mobile-first websites”, with Bootstrap 5 being the newest version. It is basically a toolkit used to help developers create visually appealing websites by providing pre-built components and styles.

## Why not use raw HTML and CSS?

Why not use raw HTML and CSS?
Are there any benefits to using UI (user-interface) frameworks like Bootstrap 5? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Well, commonly, GUI (graphical user interfaces)  designers created front-end GUI, while programmers created servers that powered the front-end. These days, the skills to work both the front and back-end is becoming more necessary. 

## My Experience

Working with Bootstrap 5 in JavaScript projects has saved time with added ease in writing code. I would say that I have become a bit reliant on the framework. I have run into some issues in producing the desired outcome, like understanding customization options or overriding default styles. Let me go ahead admit to user error on this though. My work with Bootstrap 5 with JavaScript is an ongoing process, but so far creating a webpage with the pre-built components has been enjoyable and easier than without.
